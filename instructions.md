Hello! I am an engineering manager and need an application to sequence the software development work. I want to build an application that will take demand, capacity, work break down tasks with level of efforts, and dependencies (which tasks are dependent on other tasks). All the parameters are in person weeks. The application should also take number of engineers I have on the team so that no week should have tasks more than number of engineers.
I want the output to be a gnatt chart showing what work breakdown tasks, parallelize tasks, every task can be parallelized within only 3 engineers.
A software development work sequencing application that helps teams optimize project timelines and engineer allocation through intelligent task visualization and scheduling.
Key Features:
- Interactive Gantt chart task visualization
- Dynamic engineer allocation algorithm
- Task priority and dependency management
- Responsive design for project planning
Refactor schedulingAlgorithm. Get rid of the defaults. Use only user entered maximum engineers per task.
